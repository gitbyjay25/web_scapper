## Anti-Scraping & Session Control

- Used **Selenium** with `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` to bypass basic bot detection.  
- Added `time.sleep()` to mimic human browsing behavior and avoid blocking.  
- Try-except blocks ensure missing elements donâ€™t crash the scraper.  
- Sections dynamically expanded to capture all data, achieving ~75% coverage without triggering anti-bot measures.
